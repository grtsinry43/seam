# SeamJS

**Rendering is a protocol, not a runtime.**

SeamJS decouples your UI framework, backend language, and transport channel into three independent dimensions — any combination works, and changing one never affects the others.

## How It Works

Traditional SSR and RSC tie your backend to a JavaScript runtime. SeamJS takes a different approach:

1. **Build time** — UI components are rendered to HTML skeletons with typed injection points
2. **Request time** — the server fills those slots with data via string replacement, in any language
3. **Client** — hydrates the known skeleton and takes over

The server is a data source with a template engine, not a JavaScript runtime. A Rust backend works the same as a TypeScript one. A Go backend works the same as both.

## What You Get

**Frontend** — React: client bindings, TanStack Router, filesystem router, i18n, TanStack Query integration, ESLint plugin

**Backend** — Rust (Axum) / TypeScript (Hono, Bun, Node) / Go (Gin, Chi, net/http) — symmetric feature sets, same protocol

**Procedures** — query, command, subscription, stream, upload — with codegen, namespaces, context extraction, invalidation, JTD validation

**Transport** — HTTP RPC, batch RPC, SSE, WebSocket channels, stream SSE, multipart upload

**Rendering** — CTR (compile-time), SSR ([HTML slot injection](docs/protocol/slot-protocol.md)), SSG (static/server/hybrid output modes)

**CLI** — `seam build`, `seam generate`, `seam dev`, `seam pull`, `seam clean` — with virtual modules, `loadBuild()`, structured head metadata, `defineConfig` validation

## Getting Started

Pick a standalone server example and run it:

```sh
# TypeScript (Bun)
cd examples/standalone/server-bun && bun run src/index.ts

# Rust (Axum)
cd examples/standalone/server-rust && cargo run

# Go (net/http)
cd examples/standalone/server-go && go run .
```

For a fullstack example with React frontend, see the [GitHub Dashboard](examples/github-dashboard/) — same UI running on three interchangeable backends.

## Examples

- [GitHub Dashboard](examples/github-dashboard/) — fullstack CTR with Rust, TypeScript, and Go backends
- [Markdown Demo](examples/markdown-demo/) — SSR via HTML slot injection with server-side rendering
- [i18n Demo](examples/i18n-demo/) — URL-prefix and hidden locale resolution
- [FS Router Demo](examples/fs-router-demo/) — filesystem router with all route types
- [Feature Demos](examples/features/) — channels, context, streams, queries, and handoff
- [Standalone Servers](examples/standalone/) — minimal SDK usage for each language

## Documentation

**Architecture** — [UI Layer](docs/architecture/ui-layer.md) / [Logic Layer](docs/architecture/logic-layer.md) / [Transport Layer](docs/architecture/transport-layer.md)

**Protocol** — [Slot](docs/protocol/slot-protocol.md) / [Sentinel](docs/protocol/sentinel-protocol.md) / [Manifest](docs/protocol/procedure-manifest.md) / [Subscription](docs/protocol/subscription-protocol.md) / [Channel](docs/protocol/channel-protocol.md) / [Skeleton Constraints](docs/protocol/skeleton-constraints.md)

**Development** — [Build commands, test matrix, prerequisites](docs/development.md)

## Roadmap

Soild, Svelte and Vue frontends. Tauri and Electron desktop adapters. Serverless deployment mode. Island Mode; See the [full roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

The seam protocol is open — any language that serves HTTP can be a backend. PRs for new UI frameworks, backend languages, and transport adapters are welcome.
