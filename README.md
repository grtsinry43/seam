# SeamJS

**Rendering is a protocol, not a runtime.**

The missing joint between anything that renders and anything that computes. SeamJS decouples your UI framework, backend language, and transport channel into three independent dimensions — any combination works, and adding a new option in one dimension requires zero changes in the others.

> **Audience**: SeamJS is in early development and targets developers who are comfortable reading source code, building from source, and working with unfinished APIs. It is not yet ready for general end-user consumption.
>
> **Status**: core pipeline validated with React + Rust/TypeScript/Go backends. HTTP RPC, SSE, and i18n are ready. See [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for what's next.

## Why SeamJS

SSR and RSC merge rendering into the server runtime. Your backend language must be JavaScript. Your deployment must run Node.js, etc. Your frontend framework must be the one the metaframework chose.

SeamJS rejects this coupling. The server never imports or executes UI code. Instead:

1. **Build time**: UI components are rendered to HTML skeletons with typed injection points
2. **Request time**: the server fills those slots with data via string replacement — in any language
3. **Client**: hydrates the known skeleton structure and takes over

This is **compile-time rendering (CTR)**. The server is a data source with a template engine, not a JavaScript runtime. A Rust backend works the same as a TypeScript one. A Go backend works the same as both. The UI framework is irrelevant to the server.

**SSR is still an option.** The [GitHub Dashboard](examples/github-dashboard/) ships the same UI as both CTR and [Next.js SSR](examples/github-dashboard/next-app/) to show where CTR can replace SSR without a JS runtime. When it can't, CTR and SSR are designed to coexist — see [Rendering Modes](#rendering-modes).

## Three-Axis Decoupling

SeamJS has three independent dimensions. Changing one never affects the others.

### [UI Layer](docs/architecture/ui-layer.md)

Any framework that can `renderToString` can produce a SeamJS skeleton. The framework runs only in the browser — the server never touches it. React is implemented today; Vue, Svelte, Solid, and HTMX are planned.

### [Logic Layer](docs/architecture/logic-layer.md)

The server is defined by a protocol (`/_seam/*` endpoints), not a runtime. Any language that can serve HTTP and do string replacement is a valid backend. Rust, TypeScript, and Go are implemented today — with symmetric feature sets across all three.

### [Transport Layer](docs/architecture/transport-layer.md)

Procedure handlers are pure `(input) -> output` functions. The transport (HTTP, SSE, WebSocket, IPC) is a separate adapter layer. Today: HTTP RPC, batch RPC, SSE, WebSocket, stream SSE, and upload. Planned: Tauri IPC, Electron IPC.

## Application Scenarios

### Fullstack Web

Any frontend + any backend. A React app calls typed procedures served by Rust, TypeScript, or Go — over HTTP RPC with auto-generated client code. No Node.js needed on the server. CTR replaces SSR: skeletons are built once, data is injected per request.

### Desktop

Tauri and Electron provide a window and IPC channel. SeamJS procedure handlers are transport-agnostic — swap the HTTP adapter for an IPC adapter and the same codebase runs as a desktop app. (Planned; the handler abstraction is ready, adapters are not yet built.)

### The Missing Piece for Backend Developers

If you're a Rust, Go, C++, or C# developer who wants a modern web UI without learning Next.js, Nuxt, or SvelteKit — SeamJS is the bridge. Implement the seam protocol in your language, and you get a typed frontend with React (or any future framework) without touching a JS metaframework. The protocol is simple: serve a manifest, handle RPC calls, inject data into skeletons.

## Rendering Modes

**CTR — Compile-Time Rendering** (Implemented)
Nearly zero-cost SSR. Skeletons are extracted at build time; at request time the server fills typed slots via string replacement — no JS runtime, no component tree re-rendering. This covers the vast majority of traditional SSR use cases with near-zero overhead.

**SSR — Server-Side Rendering** (Planned)
Not traditional SSR. Works alongside CTR for content that must be rendered at request time — Markdown, rich text, dynamic HTML fragments. The server renders using any tool it wants (a Rust markdown parser, Go `html/template`, or even React `renderToString`) and injects the result through a [raw HTML slot](docs/protocol/slot-protocol.md) (`<!--seam:path:html-->`). This is a CTR + SSR hybrid, not standalone SSR. Traditional SSR also works: use a TypeScript backend, import React or any UI library that provides `renderToString` / `renderToReadableStream`, and pipe the HTML into a raw slot — same mechanism, your choice of rendering strategy.

**ISR — Incremental Cache** (Planned)
Not incremental rendering — an incremental cache layer. Without server-side injection, a CTR page is naturally static and needs no regeneration. When CTR and SSR run together and produce rendering overhead, the assembled page only needs to be computed once — ISR here means caching the filled result.

**SSG — Static Site Generation** (Not Planned)
Pure static pages can be built by any UI framework natively. SeamJS provides cross-dimension abstraction for dynamic server-client interaction — SSG has no server dimension to decouple, so it falls outside SeamJS's scope.

## Current Status

**Implemented**: React frontend (client, bindings, router, filesystem router, i18n, linter). Three backend runtimes (Rust, TypeScript, Go) with symmetric feature sets. Five procedure kinds (query, command, subscription, stream, upload). HTTP RPC, batch RPC, SSE streaming, WebSocket channels, stream SSE, multipart upload. Declarative context extraction, command invalidation, per-procedure transport config. Full CLI (build, generate, dev, pull, clean). Locale resolution with URL prefix, cookie, accept-language, and query strategies.

**Next**: additional UI frameworks (Vue, Svelte), desktop adapters (Tauri/Electron).
