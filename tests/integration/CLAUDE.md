# tests/integration

Go integration tests verifying API parity across all standalone backend implementations (TS/Bun, Rust, Node).

See root CLAUDE.md for general project rules.

## How It Works

- `TestMain` builds all backends, starts them on OS-assigned random ports (`PORT=0`), health-checks via `/_seam/manifest.json`
- Each test iterates over all backends and runs the same assertions against each
- Tests cover: manifest, RPC (query, not-found, invalid body), batch RPC (multi-call, mixed success/failure), page rendering, static assets, SSE subscriptions, WebSocket channel lifecycle

## Running

```sh
cd tests/integration && go test -v -count=1
```

- Requires `cargo`, `bun`, and `tsx` to be available
- Builds Rust crate `demo-server-rust` and TS packages before starting backends

## Gotchas

- SSE test posts a message to trigger data flow; without this, headers may not flush (Bun behavior)
- Backends are killed via `Process.Kill()` in cleanup; stale processes will cause failures
